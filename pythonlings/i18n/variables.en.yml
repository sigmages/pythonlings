    Python is a language that is object oriented, strong and dynamic typing
    This means that the interpreter will dynamically set the variable type during attribuitions
    But once typed, the variable will have a type, respecting the protocols and behaviors of their type.

    You have to fix this program by attribuiting the right types to the variables!
    Remember that the types are attributed during the variable initialization.
    If you change the value, you change te final variable type! 
  variables3: |
    In Python you can assign a single value to multiple variables at same time.
    You still can assign multiple values to multiple variables, this techique is called unpacking.
  variables4: |
    Variables can be used to compound other variables trough operators and protocols (that we'll see later),
    behind the scenes, operators in Python uses protocols implemented by types to solve the operations.
    For now, we can assume that the types "int" and "str" implements the addition protocol, allowing us to sum values *at same type*, obtaining a new as result.
