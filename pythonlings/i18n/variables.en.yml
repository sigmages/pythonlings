    But once typed, the variable will have a type, respecting the protocols and behaviors of their type.

    You have to fix this program by attribuiting the right types to the variables!
    Remember that the types are attributed during the variable initialization.
    If you change the value, you change te final variable type!

    In Python you can assign a single value to multiple variables at same time.
    You still can assign multiple values to multiple variables, this techique is called unpacking.
